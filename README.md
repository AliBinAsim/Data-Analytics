# 📊 Data Preprocessing for Portfolio

This project demonstrates essential **data preprocessing techniques** using Python and pandas, as part of a real-world data analysis workflow. It is designed to showcase fundamental skills in cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for further exploration or machine learning.

## 🔧 What I Did

The following preprocessing steps were performed in the notebook:

1. Changed data types of date columns
2. Fixed column names and formatting issues
3. Removed unuseful and irrelevant columns
4. Converted data types (e.g., floats and strings into int64)
5. Checked for and removed duplicate rows and null values
6. Extracted month and year features from date columns

## 📁 File Description

- **Data_Preprocessing.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing all the above preprocessing steps with clear, step-by-step implementation.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Purpose

This notebook is part of my data analytics portfolio and demonstrates my ability to prepare raw data for analysis or modeling. Proper preprocessing is a critical step in any data science or machine learning project.
